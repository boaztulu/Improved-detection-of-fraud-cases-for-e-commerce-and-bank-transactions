# 🚨 Fraud Detection Project: Next-Gen ML & Deep Learning for Safer Transactions 🚨

Welcome to the **Fraud Detection & Explainable AI Platform** —  
an advanced project aimed at detecting and analyzing fraudulent e-commerce and banking transactions using both **traditional machine learning** and **deep learning** models.

This repository not only tackles fraud but also prioritizes transparency and trust with state-of-the-art explainability techniques like **SHAP** and **LIME**! ✨

## 📁 Project Directory Structure


---

## 🗂️ Datasets

- **Fraud_Data.csv**: Transaction details (user_id, signup/purchase time, device/browser info, demographic data, IP address, and fraud class label)
- **Credit_Card_Transactions.csv**: Anonymized credit card features (v1-v8), time, amount, and target class
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: IP address range mapping to countries

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop **high-accuracy models** to flag fraudulent transactions and credit card fraud
- Deliver **insights** into which factors drive risky behaviors
- Enhance **model transparency** using cutting-edge explainability (SHAP/LIME)
- Deploy models as a **real-time prediction API** via Flask and Docker 🐳

## 📊 Notebooks & Workflows

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and merging
- **Model Building**: 
    - Traditional ML (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)
    - Deep Learning (PyTorch RNN/CNN)
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.
- **Explainability**: 
    - **SHAP**: Global & local feature importance for every model
    - **LIME**: Instance-level explanations for ML & DL
    - **Custom functions** for PyTorch model explainability
- **API Integration**: Flask-based REST API for seamless model serving!

## 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI) Features

- **SHAP**: Visualizes overall feature impact, allowing for deep model introspection  
- **LIME**: Highlights which specific features contributed to a single prediction  
- **Support for PyTorch & Scikit-learn models**: Even neural nets are interpretable here!  
- **Visualizations**: Summary plots, force plots, and feature importances with beautiful graphics!
